Hello friends and welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on<b> Additional Features of IPython</b>.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:13
At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to: retrieve your<b> IPython</b> <b>history</b>,

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
view a part of the <b>history</b>,

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
<b>save</b> a part of a <b>history</b> to a file,

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
<b>run</b> a script from within<b> IPython</b>.

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:31
To record this tutorial, I am using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux 14.04</b> operating system,
</p>

7
00:00:32 --> 00:00:37
<b>Python 3.4.3</b>,
<p><b>IPython 5.1.0</b>
</p>

8
00:00:38 --> 00:00:47
To practice this tutorial, you should know how to
<p>use <b>plot</b>s interactively and embellish a plot.
</p>

9
00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
If not, see the pre-requisite <b>Python tutorials</b> on this website.

10
00:00:54 --> 00:01:00
Let us now open the <b>Terminal </b>by pressing <b>Ctrl+Alt+T </b>keys simultaneously.

11
00:01:01 --> 00:01:06
Now, type <b>ipython3</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

12
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
Let us initialise the <b>pylab package</b>. Type <b>percentage pylab </b>and press<b> Enter</b>.

13
00:01:14 --> 00:01:30
To start plotting, type: <b>x is equal to linspace</b> inside the brackets <b>minus 2pi comma 2pi comma 100 </b> and press<b> Enter.</b>

14
00:01:31 --> 00:01:41
Next, type: <b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>x comma xsin(x) </b>and press<b> Enter</b>.

15
00:01:42 --> 00:01:53
We got an <b>error</b> saying <b>"xsin is not defined".</b>
<p>This is because <b>xsin(x) </b>is actually <b>x </b>multiplied by <b>sin(x)</b>.
</p>

16
00:01:54 --> 00:02:12
Here, the multiplication sign is missing. So, let us now type:
<p><b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>x comma x multiplied by sin(x)</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.
</p>

17
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
Next, let us add <b>title</b> and the <b>labels</b> for both <b>x</b> and <b>y axes</b>.

18
00:02:19 --> 00:02:30
Type: <b>xlabel</b> inside the brackets inside inverted commas inside dollar sign <b>x </b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

19
00:02:31 --> 00:02:42
<b>ylabel</b> inside the brackets inside inverted commas inside dollar sign <b>f(x) </b>.

20
00:02:43 --> 00:02:56
<b>title</b> inside the brackets inside inverted commas inside dollar sign <b>x and xsin(x). </b>

21
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
We can now see the labelled <b>plot</b>.

22
00:03:01 --> 00:03:06
The <b>history</b> of typed <b>command</b>s can be retrieved by the <b> percentage history</b> command.

23
00:03:07 --> 00:03:12
Type: <b>percentage history</b> and press<b> Enter</b>.

24
00:03:13 --> 00:03:19
<b>percentage history </b>itself is a <b>command</b> and is displayed as the most recent <b>command</b>.

25
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
Whatever we executed in the <b>terminal</b>, is stored as history.

26
00:03:25 --> 00:03:32
If we want to see what was the fifth <b>command</b>, pass 5 as an <b>argument</b> to<b> percentage history </b> command.

27
00:03:33 --> 00:03:42
Type: <b>percentage history space 5 </b>and press<b> Enter</b>.
<p>This displays the fifth command which we typed. 
</p>

28
00:03:43 --> 00:03:48
Now, pause the video here and try out the following exercise and resume the video.

29
00:03:49 --> 00:03:54
Find out how to list the recent commands between 5 and 10.

30
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Switch back to the <b>terminal</b>.

31
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
Let us look at the solution.

32
00:04:00 --> 00:04:07
Type <b>clf()</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.
<p>Type: <b>percentage history question mark </b>
</p>

33
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
Read through the information of<b> percentage history</b> command.

34
00:04:13 --> 00:04:23
We can see, <b>percentage history hyphen n 4 hyphen 6</b> displays the commands from 4 to 6.

35
00:04:24 --> 00:04:36
Here, <b>hyphen n </b>is an optional <b>argument</b> which prints the line numbers.
<p>Type <b>q </b>to quit the documentation.
</p>

36
00:04:37 --> 00:04:45
Now, type: <b>percentage history space 5 hyphen 10</b> and press<b> Enter.</b>

37
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
To <b>save</b> the <b>history</b>, we use the <b>percentage save</b> command.

38
00:04:51 --> 00:04:57
Before we do that, let us first look at the <b>history</b> and identify which lines of <b>code</b> we require.

39
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
Type<b> percentage history</b> and press<b> Enter</b>.

40
00:05:03 --> 00:05:09
The second <b>command</b> is <b>linspace</b>.
<p>But the third <b>command</b> is a <b>command</b> that gave us an error. 
</p>

41
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
Hence we do not need it.

42
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
The commands from fourth to seventh are required.

43
00:05:16 --> 00:05:21
So, we need the second <b>command</b> and then the fourth to seventh <b>commands</b> for our program.

44
00:05:22 --> 00:05:46
Let us <b>save</b> it in the present <b>working directory</b>. Hence the syntax will be-
<p><b>percentage save space plot underscore script.py space 2 space 4 hyphen 7</b> and press<b> Enter</b>.
</p>

45
00:05:47 --> 00:05:55
The first <b>argument</b> in <b>percentage save</b> command is the name of the file in which the commands are saved.

46
00:05:56 --> 00:06:03
The second <b>argument</b> gives the numbers of the commands that are being saved separated by spaces.

47
00:06:04 --> 00:06:12
Let us now open the file <b>plot underscore script.py</b> and see the contents.

48
00:06:13 --> 00:06:21
Let us learn how to <b>run</b> the file as a <b>python script.</b>
<p>We use the command <b>percentage run</b> to do this. 
</p>

49
00:06:22 --> 00:06:37
Type: <b>percentage run space hyphen i space plot underscore script.py</b> and press<b> Enter.</b>

50
00:06:38 --> 00:06:49
Here, <b>hyphen i</b> parameter <b>run</b>s the <b>code</b> written in a <b>text editor</b>.
<p>The code is run within the current <b>ipython</b> session.
</p>

51
00:06:50 --> 00:06:55
It uses the <b>variables</b> defined interactively in the <b>ipython</b> session.

52
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
The script runs but we do not see the <b>plot</b>.

53
00:07:01 --> 00:07:06
This is because when we are running a script, we are not in the interactive mode.

54
00:07:07 --> 00:07:14
To view the plot, type<b> show()</b> on your <b>terminal</b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

55
00:07:15 --> 00:07:20
Pause the video here and try out the following exercise and resume.

56
00:07:21 --> 00:07:29
Use <b>percentage history</b> and<b> percentage save</b> to create a script that has the function <b>show()</b> in it.

57
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
<b>Run</b> the <b>script</b> to produce the <b>plot</b> and display the same.

58
00:07:35 --> 00:07:43
Let us look at the solution.
<p>We first look at the <b>history</b> using the<b> percentage history hyphen n</b> command.
</p>

59
00:07:44 --> 00:07:53
Type: <b>percentage history space hyphen n</b> and press<b> Enter.</b>

60
00:07:54 --> 00:08:00
Let us clear the plot window.
<p>Type <b>clf()</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.
</p>

61
00:08:01 --> 00:08:06
Now, let us save the <b>script</b> using the <b>command</b> <b>percentage save</b>.

62
00:08:07 --> 00:08:19
We need the lines 2, then 4 to 7 and 16.

63
00:08:20 --> 00:08:40
Type: <b>percentage save space show underscore included.py space 2 space 4 hyphen 7 space 16</b> and press<b> Enter</b>.

64
00:08:41 --> 00:08:56
To <b>run</b> the script, type:
<p><b>percentage run space hyphen i space show underscore included.py</b> and  press<b> Enter</b>.
</p>

65
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
We get the desired plot.

66
00:09:01 --> 00:09:15
Go to the previous command.
<p>Modify it by removing ‘<b>hyphen i’</b> in the command to <b>percentage run space show  included.py</b> and Press <b>Enter</b>.
</p>

67
00:09:16 --> 00:09:29
We see that it raises a <b>NameError</b> saying that the <b>name 'linspace' is not defined</b>.
<p>This happens because we did not <b>run</b> the script interactively.
</p>

68
00:09:30 --> 00:09:40
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt to:
<p>retrieve the <b>history</b> using <b>percentage history</b> command,
</p>

69
00:09:41 --> 00:09:47
view only a part of <b>history</b> by passing argument to<b> percentage history</b> command,

70
00:09:48 --> 00:09:54
save the required lines of code, in required order using <b>percentage save</b> command.

71
00:09:55 --> 00:10:03
Use '<b>percentage run space hyphen i'</b> command to run a saved script.

72
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
Here are some self assessment questions.

73
00:10:08 --> 00:10:16
How do you save the command lines 2 3 4 5 7 9 10 and 11?

74
00:10:17 --> 00:10:24
<b>percentage save filename 2-5 7 9 hyphen 11</b>

75
00:10:25 --> 00:10:29
<b>percentage save filename 2 hyphen 11</b>

76
00:10:30 --> 00:10:39
<b>percentage save filename</b>
<p><b>percentage save 2 hyphen 5 7 9 10 and 11</b>
</p>

77
00:10:40 --> 00:10:45
Which is the command to <b>run</b> the script?
<p><b>Percentage execute the script name</b>
</p>

78
00:10:46 --> 00:10:52
<b>percentage run hyphen i script name </b>
<p><b>percentage run script name </b>
</p>

79
00:10:53 --> 00:10:57
<b>percentage execute hyphen i script name</b>

80
00:10:58 --> 00:11:17
And the solutions are-
<p>To save the commands 2 3 4 5 7 9 10 and 11, we issue the command <b>percentage save filename 2 hyphen 5 space 7 space 9 hyphen 11</b>.
</p>

81
00:11:18 --> 00:11:26
To run the script, we use <b>percentage run space hyphen i space scriptname</b>.
