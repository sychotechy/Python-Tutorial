Hello friends! Welcome to the spoken tutorial on "<b>Multiple plots</b>".

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:14
At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
<p>draw multiple <b>plots</b> which are overlaid, 
</p>

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
use the <b>figure</b> command,

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
use the <b>legend</b> command,

5
00:00:20 --> 00:00:27
switch between the <b>plots</b> and perform some operations on each of them like saving the <b>plot</b>s.

6
00:00:28 --> 00:00:35
To record this tutorial, I am using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux 14.04</b> operating system, 
</p>

7
00:00:36 --> 00:00:41
<b>Python 3.4.3</b>,
<p><b>IPython 5.1.0</b>
</p>

8
00:00:42 --> 00:00:48
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to:
<p>use plots interactively, 
</p>

9
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
embellish a <b>plot</b>,
<p>save<b> plots</b>. 
</p>

10
00:00:53 --> 00:00:58
If not, see the pre-requisite <b>Python tutorials</b> on this website.

11
00:00:59 --> 00:01:06
Let us first open the <b>Terminal </b>by pressing <b>Ctrl+Alt+T </b>keys simultaneously.

12
00:01:07 --> 00:01:12
Now, type <b>ipython3</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

13
00:01:13 --> 00:01:20
Let us initialise the <b>pylab package</b>.
<p>Type <b>percentage pylab </b>and press<b> Enter.</b>
</p>

14
00:01:21 --> 00:01:28
Let us create a set of points for our <b>plot </b>by using the <b>command 'linspace'</b>.

15
00:01:29 --> 00:01:38
Type <b>x equals to linspace</b> inside the brackets <b>0 comma 50 comma 10</b>.

16
00:01:39 --> 00:01:50
Now, let us draw a simple <b>sine curve</b> using these points.
<p>Type <b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>x comma sin(x)</b>. 
</p>

17
00:01:51 --> 00:01:58
As we can see, this <b>sine curve</b> is not a smooth curve. What really caused this?

18
00:01:59 --> 00:02:07
This happened because we selected few points that is 10, for this large interval of 0 to 50.

19
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
'<b>Plot' function</b> does not plot the analytical function.

20
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
It plots the points given by the analytical function.

21
00:02:17 --> 00:02:28
Now, let us use <b>linspace</b> command to get 500 points between 0 and 50 and draw the <b>sine curve</b> again.

22
00:02:29 --> 00:02:38
Type <b>y equals to linspace</b> inside the brackets <b>0 comma 50 comma 500.</b>

23
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
<b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>y comma sin(y)</b>.

24
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
Now we see a <b>sine curve</b> with a smooth curve.

25
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
Notice, we will also have two plots one overlaid upon another.

26
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
In <b>pylab</b>, by default, all the plots are overlaid.

27
00:03:01 --> 00:03:06
To distinguish between two overlaid plots we use the '<b>legend' command.</b>

28
00:03:07 --> 00:03:15
Type <b>legend</b> inside the brackets <b>square brackets sin(x) comma sin(y).</b>

29
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
The <b>legend</b> command takes <b>parameter </b>as a <b>list</b> of <b>strings.</b>

30
00:03:21 --> 00:03:26
Then it assigns <b>strings</b> to<b> plots</b> in the order they were created.

31
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
Now, we can see the <b>legends</b> being displayed for the two <b>sine curves </b>on the plot area.

32
00:03:34 --> 00:03:40
In the <b>IPython terminal</b>, now type <b>clf()</b> to clear the <b>plot window</b>.

33
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
Pause the video. Try this exercise and then resume the video.

34
00:03:46 --> 00:03:55
Draw two plots, first plot being a <b>parabola</b> of the form <b>y equals to 4x square</b>,

35
00:03:56 --> 00:04:04
and the second being a straight line of the form <b>y equals to 2x plus 3</b> in the interval <b>minus 5</b> to <b>5</b>.

36
00:04:05 --> 00:04:10
Use <b>legends</b> to indicate what each <b>plot</b> is doing.

37
00:04:11 --> 00:04:24
Switch to the <b>terminal</b> for solution.
<p>Type: <b>x is equal to linspace</b> inside the brackets <b>minus 5 comma 5 comma 100</b>. 
</p>

38
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
We can obtain the two plots in different colours using the following commands.

39
00:04:31 --> 00:04:41
<b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>x comma 4 multiplied by</b> inside the brackets <b>x multiplied by x. </b>

40
00:04:42 --> 00:04:49
<b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>x comma 2 multiplied by x plus 3</b>.

41
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
Now, we will add a <b>legend</b> to identify the <b>plots</b>.

42
00:04:55 --> 00:05:18
Type: <b>legend</b> inside the brackets inside square brackets <b>r</b> inside <b>inverted commas dollar y is equal to 4 x square dollar comma r</b> inside <b>inverted commas dollar y equals to 2x plus 3 dollar. </b>

43
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
We can see the <b>legend</b> added to the <b>plot</b>.

44
00:05:24 --> 00:05:32
Next we will learn to switch between the plots and perform operations such as saving the plots etc.

45
00:05:33 --> 00:05:42
Let us see how to accomplish this. But, before we move on, let us clear our <b>screen</b>.
<p>Type: <b>clf()</b>
</p>

46
00:05:43 --> 00:05:52
Type: <b>x equals to linspace</b> inside the brackets <b>0 comma 50 comma 500</b>.

47
00:05:53 --> 00:06:02
To accomplish more control over individual plots, we use the '<b>figure' command. </b>
<p>Type: <b>figure(1)</b>
</p>

48
00:06:03 --> 00:06:11
<b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>x comma sin(x) comma inside inverted commas b</b>.

49
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
<b>figure(2)</b>

50
00:06:14 --> 00:06:23
<b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>x comma cos(x) comma</b> inside inverted commas <b>g</b>.

51
00:06:24 --> 00:06:32
Now, we have two plots, a <b>sine curve </b>and a <b>cosine curve</b>, in two different figures.

52
00:06:33 --> 00:06:42
The <b>figure</b> command takes an <b>integer</b> as an <b>argument. </b>
<p>This is the  serial number  of the  plot to select corresponding plot. 
</p>

53
00:06:43 --> 00:06:55
All the<b> plot </b>commands we <b>run</b> hereafter are applied to the selected <b>plot</b>.
<p>In this example, <b>figure 1</b> is the <b>sine plot</b> and <b>figure 2</b> is the <b>cosine  plot</b>. 
</p>

54
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
For example, we can <b>save</b> each plot separately.

55
00:07:01 --> 00:07:08
Type: <b>title</b> inside brackets inside inverted commas <b>cos(x)</b>.

56
00:07:09 --> 00:07:17
<b>savefig</b> inside the brackets inside inverted commas <b>cosine.png</b>

57
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
<b>figure(1)</b>

58
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
<b>title</b> inside the brackets inside inverted commas <b>sin(x)</b>.

59
00:07:28 --> 00:07:35
<b>savefig</b> inside the brackets inside inverted commas <b>sine.png</b>

60
00:07:36 --> 00:07:43
The figures will be saved in current <b>working directory</b>.
<p>Now, close both the <b>plot windows</b>. 
</p>

61
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
Pause the video. Try this exercise and then resume the video.

62
00:07:49 --> 00:08:04
Draw a line of the form <b>y equals to x</b> as one <b>figure</b> and another line of the form <b>y is equal to 2x plus 3</b>.
<p><b>Save</b> each of them. 
</p>

63
00:08:05 --> 00:08:14
Switch to the <b>terminal</b> for solution.
<p>To solve this problem, we will use the <b>figure</b> command to create first plotting area. 
</p>

64
00:08:15 --> 00:08:28
Type: <b>figure(1) </b>
<p><b>x equals to linspace</b> inside the brackets <b>minus 5 comma 5 comma 100</b>. 
</p>

65
00:08:29 --> 00:08:34
<b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>x comma x</b>.

66
00:08:35 --> 00:08:42
Now, use the <b>figure</b> command to create second plotting area and plot the figure.

67
00:08:43 --> 00:08:55
Type: <b>figure(2) </b>
<p><b>plot</b> inside the brackets <b>x comma 2x plus 3</b>. 
</p>

68
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
We will <b>save</b> the figure as follows.

69
00:08:59 --> 00:09:10
Type: <b>figure(1)</b>
<p><b>savefig</b> inside brackets inside inverted commas <b>plot1.png</b>
</p>

70
00:09:11 --> 00:09:22
<b>figure(2)</b>
<p><b>savefig</b> inside the brackets inside inverted commas <b>plot2.png</b>
</p>

71
00:09:23 --> 00:09:32
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt to:
<p>draw multiple plots which are overlaid, 
</p>

72
00:09:33 --> 00:09:34
use the <b>figure</b> command,

73
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
use the <b>legend</b> command,

74
00:09:38 --> 00:09:45
switch between the plots and perform some operations on each of them like saving the plots.

75
00:09:46 --> 00:09:54
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve-
<p>What <b>command</b> is used to get individual plots separately? 
</p>

76
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
What will be the <b>command</b> to identify <b>sine</b> and <b>cosine curve</b>?

77
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
And the answers are-
<p>The <b>command "figure()"</b> can get us the individual plots separately. 
</p>

78
00:10:07 --> 00:10:20
The <b>legend</b> command-  <b>legend</b> inside the brackets inside square brackets inside inverted commas <b>sin(x) comma inside inverted commas </b>cos(x)<b>.</b>

00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
