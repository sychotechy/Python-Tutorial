Hello Friends. Welcome to the tutorial on "<b>Statistics</b>‚Äù using <b>Python</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:13
At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to - Do <b>statistical</b> operations in <b>Python</b>

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:21
<b>Sum</b> a set of numbers and Find their <b>mean, median</b> and <b>standard deviation</b>

4
00:00:22 --> 00:00:28
To record this tutorial, I am using <b>Ubuntu Linux 16.04</b> operating system

5
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
<b>Python 3.4.3 </b>and <b>IPython 5.1.0</b>

6
00:00:36 --> 00:00:41
To practise this tutorial, you should know how to load data from files

7
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
use <b>Lists</b> and access parts of <b>Arrays</b>

8
00:00:47 --> 00:00:52
If not, see the pre-requisite <b>Python</b> tutorials on this website.

9
00:00:53 --> 00:01:02
For this tutorial, we will use the data file <b>student_record.txt </b>which we used in the earlier tutorial.

10
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
You can also find this file in the <b>Code Files</b> link of this tutorial.

11
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
Please download it in <b>Home directory</b> and use it.

12
00:01:12 --> 00:01:21
We will use mathematical and logical operations on this <b>array structured file</b>.
<p>For this, we need to install <b>Numpy</b>.
</p>

13
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
<b>NumPy</b>, stands for <b>Numerical Python.</b>

14
00:01:26 --> 00:01:32
It is a library consisting of <b>pre-compiled functions</b> for mathematical and numerical routines.

15
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
<b>NumPy</b> has to be installed separately.

16
00:01:37 --> 00:01:44
Let us first open the <b>Terminal </b>by pressing <b>Ctrl+Alt+T </b>keys simultaneously.

17
00:01:45 --> 00:01:52
Let us install latest <b>pip</b>.
<p><b>pip</b> command is used to install<b> python libraries.</b>
</p>

18
00:01:53 --> 00:02:02
Type, <b>sudo apt-get install python3  hyphen pip</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

19
00:02:03 --> 00:02:14
You need to have <b>root</b> access for installation as it asks for <b>admin password</b>.

20
00:02:15 --> 00:02:23
Next, we need to install <b>numpy library</b> as we will be using <b>numpy library</b> throughout the tutorial.

21
00:02:24 --> 00:02:37
Type, <b>sudo pip3 install numpy </b>is equal to is equal to<b> 1.13.3 </b>and press<b> Enter.</b>

22
00:02:38 --> 00:02:46
The installation is completed successfully. We can see the <b>terminal prompt</b> without any error.

23
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
Next we will learn about <b>loadtxt() function.</b>

24
00:02:52 --> 00:02:57
To get the data as an <b>array</b>, we use the <b>loadtxt() function.</b>

25
00:02:58 --> 00:03:03
For <b>loadtxt() function</b>, we need to <b>import numpy library</b> first.

26
00:03:04 --> 00:03:11
Switch back to the <b>terminal</b>.Now, type <b>ipython3</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

27
00:03:12 --> 00:03:23
Type <b>import numpy as np</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.
<p>Where <b>np</b> is alias to <b>numpy</b> and it can be any name.
</p>

28
00:03:24 --> 00:03:31
Let us load the data from the file <b>student_record.txt </b>as an <b>array</b>.

29
00:03:32 --> 00:04:03
Type, <b>L</b> is equal to <b>np dot loadtxt</b> inside <b>parentheses</b> inside quotes <b>student_record.txt</b> comma <b>usecols</b> is equal to inside <b>parentheses</b> 3 comma 4 comma 5 comma 6 comma 7 comma <b>delimiter</b> is equal to inside quotes <b>semicolon</b> and Press <b>Enter</b>.

30
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
Type<b> L </b>and press<b> Enter</b>.

31
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
We get the <b>output</b> in the form of an <b>array</b>.

32
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
<b>loadtxt</b> loads data from an external file.

33
00:04:16 --> 00:04:26
<p><b>Delimiter</b> specifies the kind of character that the <b>fields</b> of data is separated by. 
</p><p><b>usecols</b> specifies the <b>columns</b> to be used. 
</p>

34
00:04:27 --> 00:04:32
<b>loadtxt, delimiter</b> and <b>usecols</b> are <b>keywords</b>.

35
00:04:33 --> 00:04:41
So <b>columns</b> 3,4,5,6,7 from <b>student_record.txt </b>are loaded here.

36
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
The 'comma' between <b>column numbers</b> is added because <b>usecols</b> is a <b>sequence</b>.

37
00:04:49 --> 00:04:57
As we can see <b>L</b> is an <b>array</b>. We can get the shape of this <b>array</b> using <b>shape.</b>

38
00:04:58 --> 00:05:03
Type, <b>L dot shape </b>and press <b>Enter</b>.

39
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
We get a <b>tuple</b> giving the numbers of <b>rows</b> and <b>columns</b> respectively.

40
00:05:11 --> 00:05:21
In this example, the array <b>L </b>has one lakh eighty five thousand six hundred and sixty seven rows and 5 columns.

41
00:05:22 --> 00:05:27
Let us switch back to the <b>student_record.txt</b> file.

42
00:05:28 --> 00:05:38
Let us start applying statistical operations on these.
<p>How do you find the sum of marks of all subjects for the first student?
</p>

43
00:05:39 --> 00:05:53
Switch back to the <b>terminal</b>.
<p>To access the first row in an <b>array</b>, we will type <b>L </b>inside square brackets <b>0 </b>and press <b>Enter</b>.
</p>

44
00:05:54 --> 00:06:08
Now to sum this, type, <b>totalmarks </b>is equal to <b>sum </b>inside parentheses <b>L </b>inside square brackets <b>0 </b> and Press <b>Enter.</b>

45
00:06:09 --> 00:06:18
Type <b>totalmarks </b>and press <b>Enter.</b>
<p>We got sum of marks of all subjects of the first student.
</p>

46
00:06:19 --> 00:06:25
Now to get the <b>mean</b> we can divide the <b>totalmarks</b> by the length of the <b>array.</b>

47
00:06:26 --> 00:06:39
Type, <b>totalmarks </b>divided by <b>len</b> inside parentheses <b>L</b> inside square brackets <i><b>0 </b>and press <b>Enter.</b></i>

48
00:06:40 --> 00:06:54
Or simply use the <b>function mean</b>. Type <b>np dot mean</b> inside parentheses <b>L </b>inside square brackets <b>0 </b>and press<b> Enter.</b>

49
00:06:55 --> 00:07:03
But we have such a large <b>data</b> <b>set</b>.
<p>And calculating the <b>mean</b> for each student one by one is time consuming. 
</p>

50
00:07:04 --> 00:07:11
Is there a way to reduce the work?
<p>For this, we will look into the <b>documentation</b> of <b>mean.</b>
</p>

51
00:07:12 --> 00:07:22
Type, <b>np dot mean questionmark </b>and press Enter<i>.</i> Read the text for more information.

52
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
Type <b>q </b>to exit the documentation.

53
00:07:28 --> 00:07:34
In the above example, <b>L</b> is a <b>two dimensional array </b>like <b>matrix</b>.

54
00:07:35 --> 00:07:40
We can calculate the <b>mean</b> across each of the <b>axis</b> of the <b>array</b>.

55
00:07:41 --> 00:07:47
The <b>axis</b> of <b>rows</b> is referred by 0 and <b>columns</b> by 1.

56
00:07:48 --> 00:07:56
To calculate <b>mean</b> across all <b>columns</b>, we have to pass extra parameter 1 for the <b>axis</b>.

57
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
Switch back to the <b>terminal</b>.

58
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
Let us calculate, <b>mean</b> of the marks scored by all the students for each subject.

59
00:08:07 --> 00:08:17
Type <b>np dot mean </b>inside parentheses <b>L  comma 0</b> <i>and press <b>Enter</b>.</i>

60
00:08:18 --> 00:08:24
Next, we will calculate the <b>median</b> of English marks for all the students.

61
00:08:25 --> 00:08:34
Type <b>L </b>inside square brackets <b>colon comma 0 </b>and press <b>Enter</b>.

62
00:08:35 --> 00:08:44
Note <b>colon comma zero</b> displays first <b>column</b> in the <b>array</b> that is, English Mark.

63
00:08:45 --> 00:08:50
To get the <b>median</b> we will simply use the <b>function median</b>.

64
00:08:51 --> 00:09:03
Type <b>np dot median </b>inside parentheses <b>L </b>inside square brackets <b>colon</b> comma <b>0 </b>
<p>Press <b>Enter</b>.
</p>

65
00:09:04 --> 00:09:12
For all the subjects, we can calculate <b>median</b> across all <b>rows</b> using <b>median function</b> as shown here.

66
00:09:13 --> 00:09:23
Type <b>np dot median </b>inside parentheses <b>L comma 0</b>
<p>Press <b>Enter</b>.
</p>

67
00:09:24 --> 00:09:30
Similarly to calculate <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> we will use the <b>function std</b>

68
00:09:31 --> 00:09:49
Standard deviation for English subject can be found by typing <b>np  dot std </b>inside parentheses <b>L </b>inside square brackets <b>colon comma 0</b>. Press <b>Enter</b>.

69
00:09:50 --> 00:10:02
And for all <b>rows</b>, we do, <b>np dot std </b>inside parentheses <b>L comma 0 </b>and press <b>Enter.</b>

70
00:10:03 --> 00:10:08
Pause the video here, try out the following exercise and resume the video.

71
00:10:09 --> 00:10:17
Refer to the file<b> football.txt</b>, that is available in the <b>Code Files</b> link of this tutorial.

72
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
Download and save the file in the <b>present working directory</b>.

73
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
Currently the <b>present working directory</b> is the <b>Home directory.</b>

74
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
In <b>football.txt</b>, the first column is <b>player name</b>,

75
00:10:34 --> 00:10:41
Second is <b>goals</b> <b>at home</b> and third is <b>goals away</b>.

76
00:10:42 --> 00:10:49
Find the total goals for each player
<p><b>Mean</b> of home and goals away
</p>

77
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
<b>Standard deviation</b> of home and goals away

78
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
Switch to the terminal.

79
00:10:58 --> 00:11:30
The solution is, first, type, <b>L</b> is equal to <b>np dot loadtxt</b> inside parentheses inside quotes <b>football.txt comma usecols</b> is equal to inside parentheses <b>1 comma 2 comma delimiter</b> is equal to inside quotes <b>comma</b>. Press <b>Enter</b>.

80
00:11:31 --> 00:11:38
<b>np dot sum </b>inside parentheses <b>L comma 1 </b>and press <b>Enter</b>.

81
00:11:39 --> 00:11:49
The answer for the second, <b>np dot mean </b>inside parentheses <b>L comma 0 </b>and press <b>Enter</b>.

82
00:11:50 --> 00:11:58
Third, <b>np dot std </b>inside parentheses <b>L comma 0 </b>and press <b>Enter</b>.

83
00:11:59 --> 00:12:17
This brings us to the end of the tutorial.
<p>In this tutorial, we have learnt to do the standard <b>statistical operations</b> like:  <b>sum</b>, <b>mean</b>, <b>median</b> and <b>standard deviation</b> in <b>Python</b>.
</p>

84
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve.

85
00:12:23 --> 00:12:31
Given a <b>two dimensional list </b>as shown, how do you calculate the <b>mean</b> of each row?

86
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
Second. Calculate the <b>median</b> of the given <b>list</b>.

87
00:12:37 --> 00:12:50
Third. There is a <b>file</b> with 6 <b>columns</b>. But we want to load text only from <b>columns</b> 2,3,4,5.
<p>How do we specify that?
</p>

88
00:12:51 --> 00:13:01
And the answers,
<p>To get the <b>mean</b> of each <b>row</b>, we just pass 1 as the second <b>parameter</b> to the <b>function mean</b>
</p>

89
00:13:02 --> 00:13:10
<b>np.mean </b>inside parentheses<b> two_dimensional_list comma 1</b>

90
00:13:11 --> 00:13:23
We use the <b>function median</b> to calculate the <b>median</b> of the <b>list</b>
<p><b>np.median </b>inside parentheses <b>student_marks</b>
</p>

91
00:13:24 --> 00:13:38
Third, To specify the particular <b>columns</b> of a file, we use the parameter <b>usecols </b>is equal to inside parentheses <b>2, 3, 4, 5</b>

92
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
