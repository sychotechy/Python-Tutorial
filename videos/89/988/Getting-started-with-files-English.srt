Hello Friends. Welcome to the tutorial on "Getting started with <b>files</b>".

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:12
At the end of this tutorial, you will learn to Open a file.

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
Read the contents of the file line by line.

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
Read the entire content of the file at once.

5
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
Append the lines of a file to a <b>list</b> and Close the file.

6
00:00:26 --> 00:00:39
To record this tutorial, I am using
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux 16.04</b> operating system
</p><p><b>Python 3.4.3 </b>and <b>IPython 5.1.0</b>
</p>

7
00:00:40 --> 00:00:47
To practice this tutorial, you should know about
<p><b>Lists</b> and <b>for statement</b>
</p>

8
00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
If not, see the pre-requisite <b>Python</b> tutorials on this website.

9
00:00:54 --> 00:01:00
To open a file for reading or writing, we can use a <b>built in function</b> called <b>open()</b>.

10
00:01:01 --> 00:01:11
<b>Open() function</b> returns a <b>file object</b>.
<p>The syntax is shown here.
</p><p><b>Filename</b>  is the name of the file to be opened.
</p>

11
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
<b>Mode</b>- This indicates how the file is going to be opened.

12
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
r is for <b>Read mode</b>

13
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
w is for <b>Write mode</b>

14
00:01:23 --> 00:01:31
a represents <b>Appending mode</b> and r+  for both <b>Read and Write mode</b>
<p>Specifying <b>mode</b> is optional.
</p>

15
00:01:32 --> 00:01:37
Let us open a file <b>pendulum.txt</b> in a text editor.

16
00:01:38 --> 00:01:48
This file contains 2 data columns, <b>length</b> and <b>time</b> of <b>pendulum</b>.
<p>We will be using this text file for our demonstration.
</p>

17
00:01:49 --> 00:01:59
The file <b>pendulum.txt</b> is available in the <b>Code File link</b> of this tutorial.
<p>Please download it in <b>Home directory</b> and use it.
</p>

18
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
Let us first open the <b>Terminal </b>by pressing <b>Ctrl+Alt+T </b>keys simultaneously.

19
00:02:07 --> 00:02:11
Type <b>ipython3</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

20
00:02:12 --> 00:02:19
Let us initialise the <b>pylab package</b>.
<p>Type <b>%pylab </b>and press<b> Enter.</b>
</p>

21
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
Let us clear the <b>terminal</b>.

22
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
Let us open the file <b>pendulum.txt.</b>

23
00:02:27 --> 00:02:37
Type <b>f</b><i> is equal to</i><b> open</b><i> inside parentheses inside quotes </i><b>pendulum </b><i>dot </i><b>txt</b>

24
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
Here the <b>mode</b> is not specified. By default, it is <b>‘r’</b>.

25
00:02:43 --> 00:02:47
Let us type <b>f</b> on the <b>terminal</b> to see what it is.

26
00:02:48 --> 00:02:56
The <b>file object f</b> shows the filename and <b>mode</b> of the file which is open.

27
00:02:57 --> 00:03:05
'<b>r' </b>stands for <b>read only mode</b>.
<p>As you can see, this <b>file</b> is open in <b>read only mode</b>.
</p>

28
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
Now let us learn to read the whole <b>file</b> into a single <b>variable</b>.

29
00:03:11 --> 00:03:17
Type <b>pend </b><i>equal to </i><b>f </b><i>dot </i><b>read<i> </i></b><i>open and close parentheses.</i>

30
00:03:18 --> 00:03:26
We use the <b>read method</b> to read all the contents of the file into the <b>variable pend</b>
<p>Press <b>Enter</b>
</p>

31
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
To use <b>read method</b> we use the <b>file object dot read method</b>.

32
00:03:34 --> 00:03:43
Now, let us see what <b>pend </b>contains, by typing <b>print </b><i>inside parentheses </i><b>pend.</b>
<p>Press <b>Enter</b>
</p>

33
00:03:44 --> 00:03:49
We can see that <b>pend</b> has all the data of the <b>file pendulum.txt</b>.

34
00:03:50 --> 00:03:55
Type just <b>pend</b> to see more explicitly, what it contains.

35
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
We can see the <b>newline characters</b> as well, in the output.

36
00:04:01 --> 00:04:06
Let us learn to split the <b>variable pend</b> into a <b>list</b> of lines in the file.

37
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
We use the <b>method splitlines</b> to split a file of data into <b>list</b> of lines.

38
00:04:14 --> 00:04:20
For this we need to store this <b>list </b>in a <b>variable</b>, say <b>pend_list</b>

39
00:04:21 --> 00:04:32
Type <b>pend_list </b><i>equal to</i><b> pend </b><i>dot </i><b>splitlines </b><i>open and close parentheses</i>
<p>Press <b>Enter</b>
</p>

40
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
Type <b>pend </b><i>underscore </i><b>list </b>
<p>Press <b>Enter</b>
</p>

41
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
We got the data into <b>list</b> of lines.

42
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
<b>pend_list</b> does not contain <b>newline characters </b>like <b>\n</b>.

43
00:04:47 --> 00:04:52
This is because the <b>string pend</b> is split on the <b>newline characters</b>.

44
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
Let us close the <b>file</b> opened into <b>f</b>.

45
00:04:57 --> 00:05:03
Type <b>f  dot close </b> <i>open and close parentheses</i>
<p>Press <b>Enter</b>
</p>

46
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
It is a good programming practice  to <b>close</b> any <b>file objects</b> that we have opened
<p>after their job is done.
</p>

47
00:05:11 --> 00:05:16
Pause the video here, try out the following exercise and then resume the video.

48
00:05:17 --> 00:05:22
Re-open the file <b>pendulum.txt</b> with <b>f</b> as the <b>file object</b>.

49
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
Recall that we have closed the file earlier.

50
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
Let us switch back to the terminal.

51
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
Let us now move on to reading files line by line.

52
00:05:34 --> 00:05:46
To re-open the file again, type
<p><b>f </b><i>is equal to </i><b>open </b><i>inside parentheses inside quotes </i><b>pendulum.txt</b>
</p>

53
00:05:47 --> 00:05:53
Now, to read the file line-by-line, we <b>iterate</b> over the <b>file object</b> using the <b>for loop</b>.

54
00:05:54 --> 00:06:02
Let us <b>iterate</b> over the <b>file</b> line-wise and <b>print</b> each of the lines.
<p>Let us clear the <b>terminal</b>.
</p>

55
00:06:03 --> 00:06:15
Type <b>for line in f colon</b> press <b>Enter</b>
<p><b>four spaces print inside parentheses line</b>
</p>

56
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
Here, <b>line</b> is a <b>loop variable</b>, and it is not a <b>keyword</b>.

57
00:06:21 --> 00:06:29
We could have used any other <b>variable</b> name, but <b>line</b> seems meaningful enough.
<p>Press <b>Enter</b> twice.
</p>

58
00:06:30 --> 00:06:36
Instead of just printing the lines, let us append them into a <b>list</b>, say <b>line_list</b>.

59
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
We first <b>initialize</b> a <b>line_list </b>as an <b>empty-list</b>

60
00:06:42 --> 00:06:53
Type, <b>line <i>underscore </i>list <i>is</i> <i>equal to </i>open and close square brackets.</b>
<p>Press Enter
</p>

61
00:06:54 --> 00:07:09
Type the code as
<p><b>for line in open <i>inside parentheses inside quotes </i>pendulum <i>dot</i> txt colon</b> press <b>Enter</b>
</p>

62
00:07:10 --> 00:07:22
<b><i>four space</i> line<i> underscore</i> list <i>dot </i>append <i>inside parentheses</i> line</b>
<p>Press <b>Enter</b> twice.
</p>

63
00:07:23 --> 00:07:28
Here, the <b>for loop </b>reads the file <b>pendulum.txt </b>line-by-line.

64
00:07:29 --> 00:07:34
The <b>append method</b> will add each of the line to the <b>list, line_list.</b>

65
00:07:35 --> 00:07:41
We could, as usual close the file using <b>f.close() </b>and re-open it.

66
00:07:42 --> 00:07:49
But, this time, let's leave the <b>file object f </b>and directly open the file within the <b>for statement</b>.

67
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
This will save us the trouble of closing the file, each time we open it.

68
00:07:55 --> 00:08:04
Let us see what <b>line_list</b> contains.
<p>Type <b>line <i>underscore </i> list </b>and press <b>Enter.</b>
</p>

69
00:08:05 --> 00:08:12
<b>line <i>underscore </i> list</b> is a <b>list</b> of the lines in the file, along with the <b>newline characters</b>.

70
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
We can strip out the <b>newline characters</b> from the lines by using some <b>string methods</b>.

71
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
This will be covered in the further tutorial on <b>strings</b>.

72
00:08:25 --> 00:08:37
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
<p>In this tutorial, we learnt to - Open and close files using the <b>open</b> and <b>close methods</b> respectively.
</p>

73
00:08:38 --> 00:08:42
Read the data in the files as a whole, by using the <b>read method</b>.

74
00:08:43 --> 00:08:49
Read the data in the files line by line by iterating over the <b>file object</b> using the <b>for loop</b>.

75
00:08:50 --> 00:08:55
Append the lines of a file to a <b>list</b> using the <b>append method</b> within the <b>for loop</b>.

76
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve

77
00:09:01 --> 00:09:06
1. The <b>open function</b> returns a
<p><b>string</b>, <b>list</b>, <b>file object</b>, <b>function</b>
</p>

78
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
2. What does the <b>function splitlines()</b> do.

79
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
Displays the data as <b>strings</b> all in a line

80
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
Displays the data line by line as <b>strings</b>

81
00:09:18 --> 00:09:23
Displays the data line by line but not as <b>strings</b>

82
00:09:24 --> 00:09:30
And the answers are,
<p>1. <b>open function</b> returns a <b>file object</b>
</p>

83
00:09:31 --> 00:09:36
<b>splitlines() </b>displays the data line by line as <b>strings</b>

84
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
