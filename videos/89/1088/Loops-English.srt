00:00:01 --> 00:00:04
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on <b>Loops</b>.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:17
In this tutorial, we will learn to use,
<p><b>for loop</b>
</p><p><b>while loop</b>
</p><p><b>break, continue </b>and<b> pass statements</b> in the <b>loops</b>
</p>

3
00:00:18 --> 00:00:33
To record this tutorial, I am using
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux 16.04</b> operating system
</p><p><b>Python 3.4.3 </b>and
</p><p><b>IPython 5.1.0</b>
</p>

4
00:00:34 --> 00:00:44
To practice this tutorial, you should know how to
<p>use<b> conditional statements</b>
</p><p>If not, see the relevant <b>Python</b> tutorials on this website.
</p>

5
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
Let us begin the tutorial with <b>while loop</b>.

6
00:00:49 --> 00:00:55
The <b>while loop</b> is used to execute a set of <b>statements</b> as long as a condition is <b>true.</b>

7
00:00:56 --> 00:01:02
When the condition becomes <b>false</b>, program control passes to the line immediately after the <b>loop</b>.

8
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
The code inside the <b>while loop </b>should be indented four spaces to the right.

9
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
Let us start <b>ipython.</b>  Open the <b>terminal.</b>

10
00:01:14 --> 00:01:25
Type <b>ipython3 </b>and press <b>Enter.</b>
<p>From here onwards, remember to press the <b>Enter</b> key after typing every command on the <b>terminal</b>.
</p>

11
00:01:26 --> 00:01:31
Let us <b>print</b> the squares of all the odd numbers less than 10, using the <b>while loop</b>.

12
00:01:32 --> 00:01:49
Type, <b>i </b><i>is equal to</i><b> 1</b> <b>while i </b><i>less than </i><b>10 </b><i>colon</i> <b>print </b><i>inside brackets </i><b>i </b><i>asterisk </i><b>i</b> <b>i </b><i>plus equal to </i><b>2</b>

13
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
Here the <b>while loop</b> repeatedly checks the condition.

14
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
If it is <b>True</b>, it <b>executes</b> the <b>block</b> of <b>code </b>within the <b>loop</b>.

15
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
Then press the <b>Enter</b> key twice to get the output.

16
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
Next let us now solve the same problem using <b>for loop</b>.

17
00:02:09 --> 00:02:23
Type, <b>for n in range </b><i>inside brackets </i><b>1, 10, 2 </b><i>colon</i> <b>print </b><i>inside brackets </i><b>n </b><i>asterisk </i><b>n</b>

18
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
As we know, the <b>for loop</b> iterates over a <b>list</b> or any other <b>sequential data type</b>.

19
00:02:30 --> 00:02:39
So, we use the <b>range </b>function to<b> </b>get a list of odd numbers below 10 and iterate over it. Then we print the square of <b>n</b>.

20
00:02:40 --> 00:02:51
Press <b>Enter</b> twice. We can see that we got the same output as before.  Note that now the lines of code are less.

21
00:02:52 --> 00:02:57
Pause the video here. Try this exercise and then resume the video.

22
00:02:58 --> 00:03:03
Write a <b>while loop</b> to print the squares of all the even numbers below 10.

23
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
Switch back to the <b>terminal</b> for the solution.

24
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
Type, <b>i </b><i>is equal to</i><b> 2</b>

25
00:03:12 --> 00:03:25
<b>while i </b><i>less than</i><b> 10 </b><i>colon</i> <b>print </b><i>inside brackets </i><b>i </b><i>asterisk </i><b>i</b> <b>i </b><i>plus equal to </i><b>2</b>

26
00:03:26 --> 00:03:31
Press the <b>Enter </b>key twice. We got the required output.

27
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
Pause the video here. Try this exercise and then resume the video.

28
00:03:39 --> 00:03:44
Write a <b>for loop</b> to print the squares of all the even numbers below 10.

29
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
Switch back to the <b>terminal</b> for the solution.

30
00:03:49 --> 00:04:08
Type, <b>for n in range </b><i>inside brackets</i><b> 2, 10, 2 </b><i>colon</i> <b>print </b><i>inside brackets</i><b> n</b><i> asterisk </i><b>n</b>
<p>Press <b>Enter</b> twice. We got the required output.
</p>

31
00:04:09 --> 00:04:14
Next let us see at how to use the<b> break, pass </b>and <b>continue</b> keywords.

32
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
Now type this code to understand the <b>pass statement.</b>

33
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
As we already know, <b>pass</b> is just a <b>placeholder</b>.

34
00:04:24 --> 00:04:30
It is used for the sake of completion of <b>blocks</b>, that do not have any <b>code</b> within them.

35
00:04:31 --> 00:04:41
Nothing gets printed when we execute this code. Press <b>Enter</b> twice. As we expected nothing gets printed.

36
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
Next let us understand about the <b>break statement.</b>

37
00:04:46 --> 00:04:52
<b>break</b> is used to break the innermost <b>loop</b>.  Type the code as shown.

38
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
Here, it will <b>iterate </b>each letter in the word <b>python.</b>

39
00:04:58 --> 00:05:06
And it <b>breaks </b>the loop when <b>h </b>is the <b>iteration</b> value. Press <b>Enter</b> twice to see the output.

40
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
Next let us understand about the <b>continue statement.</b>

41
00:05:12 --> 00:05:26
Type the code as shown. The<b> continue statement</b> rejects all the remaining <b>statements</b> in the current iteration of the <b>loop</b>.
<p>And it moves the control back to the top of the <b>loop</b>. 
</p>

42
00:05:27 --> 00:05:34
It will print the squares of all the odd numbers below 10 which are not multiples of 3.

43
00:05:35 --> 00:05:40
Press <b>Enter</b> twice. We got the required output.

44
00:05:41 --> 00:05:46
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarise.

45
00:05:47 --> 00:06:04
In this tutorial, we have learnt to,
<p><b>Iterate</b> over a <b>sequence</b> using <b>for </b><i>and </i><b>while loops</b>
</p><p><b>Break</b> out of <b>loops</b> using <b>break statement</b>
</p><p>Skip <b>iterations</b> using <b>continue statement</b>
</p><p>Use the <b>pass statement</b> in a <b>loop</b>
</p>

46
00:06:05 --> 00:06:23
Here are some self assessment questions for you to solve
<p>Given <b>range(1,4)</b>, write a <b>code</b> to <b>print</b> only the number 1.
</p><p>Which <b>statement</b> do you use to skip <b>iterations</b>? 
</p>

47
00:06:24 --> 00:06:36
And the answers,
<p>We can use the <b>break statement</b> in the <b>for loop</b> as shown here
</p><p>In order to skip <b>iterations</b>, we can use the <b>continue statement</b>.
</p>
